Description: This program is an interactive data-driven
web-based Python application that uses real-world data.
The program uses a database with information of Fortune 500
Corporate Headquarters, including its location, financial metrics, and number of employees.
This data is presented in an interactive way through visual elements:
maps, stacked bar charts, scatter plots, and tables.
The users can filter the data using sidebars with options for location, profit, and rank.
Lastly, there is a revenue summary statistics visual to grasp an even more understanding of the whole data.
